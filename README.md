__musi(c|k) playlist__


machine consumable playlist of my favorite YouTube songs.  
the format may be provided in multiple forms, but I would like to try [TomL](https://github.com/mojombo/toml).  

__ordering__

the ordering could be dependent on the programming language consuming the content, for example on Ruby1.8
insertion order is not preserved but on Ruby1.9+ insertion order is assumed. it is considered to be an 
"implementation" detail from what I've heard.

__the music?__

upbeat, positive sounds from a diverse range of artists.

__when?__

I am without a working laptop/netbook, and I am using a public computer to write this document.  
I will start work on building the list(stored as a key+value store) as soon as I have a working
machine/computer.
